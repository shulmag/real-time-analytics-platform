    "The DataLoader class grabs the data from BigQuery and returns the dataset as a dataframe. The query creates an array of all trades for every CUSIP. The query drops the trades that have been canceled. We calculate the yield spreads by taking the diffrence of the bond's yield and the yield of the [s&p muni bond index](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/fixed-income/sp-municipal-bond-index/#overview). To test the implementation I have limited the number of rows to 200, this can easily be changed by removing the limit in the DATA_QUERY.\n",

    "The dataset is split into training and testing, with 85% of the data being used to train the model. The parameter that decides the ratio of train test split is defined in the cells above. We create a sequence of 5 trades and feed that into the model. The sequence parameter is defined as a hyper-parameter and can be easily changed. The sequence contains the yield spreads, prices, par traded value, the type of trade, and the number of days ago the trade was executed. Additional features can be added with a few minor tweaks to the source code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I do a few blunt normalizations to help the model learn. I multiply the yield spreads by 100 to convert the units to basis points and divide the par trade value by 1000 to reduce the absolute scale. We can try other normalization schemes to see how that affects the learning of the model\n"
