This function is a helper function for `compute_price`. This function calculates the price of a trade, where `yield_rate` 
is a specific yield and `end_date` is a fixed repayment date. All dates must be valid relative to the settlement 
date, as opposed to the trade date. Note that "yield" is a reserved word in Python and should not be used as the name 
of a variable or column.

Formulas are from https://www.msrb.org/pdf.aspx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msrb.org%2FRules-and-Interpretations%2FMSRB-Rules%2FGeneral%2FRule-G-33.aspx.
For all bonds, `base` is the present value of future cashflows to the buyer. 
The clean price is this price minus the accumulated amount of simple interest that the buyer must pay to the seller, which is called `accrued`.
Zero-coupon bonds are handled first. For these, the yield is assumed to be compounded semi-annually, i.e., once every six months.
For bonds with non-zero coupon, the first and last interest payment periods may have a non-standard length,
so they must be handled separately.

When referring to the formulas in the MSRB handbook (link above), the below variables map to the code.
A: prev_coupon_date_to_settlement_date
B: NUM_OF_DAYS_IN_YEAR
Y: yield_rate
N: num_of_interest_payments
E: num_of_days_in_period
F: settlement_date_to_next_coupon_date
P: price
D: settlement_date_to_end_date
H: prev_coupon_date_to_end_date
R: coupon
