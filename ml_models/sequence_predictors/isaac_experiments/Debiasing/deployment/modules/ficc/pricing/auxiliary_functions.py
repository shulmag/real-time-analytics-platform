This function is called when the interest is only paid at maturity (which is represented 
in the transformed dataframe as interest payment frequency equaling 0). There are two 
cases when interest is paid at maturity. The first case is for short term bonds where 
there is a single coupon payment at maturity, and this logic will reduce to the logic 
in MSRB Rule Book G-33, rule (b)(i)(A). The second case is when when there is a compounding 
accreted value (i.e., capital appreciation bonds) which accrues semianually. Then, to get 
the price of this bond, we need to account for the accrued interest. This can be thought 
of as a bond that pays a coupon semiannually through the duration of the bond, but all the 
coupon payments are made as a single payment at the time the bond is called / maturity.
