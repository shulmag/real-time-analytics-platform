    "### Computing the price in dollars of a trade, given the yield, and vice versa: get_price and get_ytw\n",

    "Version dated July 19, 2021, most recently edited by Charles Elkan.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides code to compute dollar prices, and compares the results to the prices reported by MSRB.\n",
    "After the code for calculations, there is an analysis of discrepancies. \n",
    "When performed for multiple specific days, this analysis uncovers anomalies in MSRB or ICE data\n",
    "that are summarized in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ID3sdUC_Vvei-Cb-rUsrz0m_XFlAmcmlvhn57SNjwfo/edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one cusip for which the evidence suggests that the code below is incorrect, namely 34061YAH3.\n",
    "Our calculated price is too small by about 0.3, compared to the MSRB price,\n",
    "i.e., about 30 cents out of $100. Our calculation becomes correct if the “dated date” is changed to be two weeks later than the date given by both ICE and MSRB. We don’t know for sure what value for “dated date” is used in the MSRB calculation.\n",
