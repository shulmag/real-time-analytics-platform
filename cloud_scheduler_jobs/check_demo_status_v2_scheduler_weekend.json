    "description": "Run check_demo_status_v2 every four hours from 1am to 5pm eastern time. The lower frequency on weekends is to save Google Cloud costs that are incurred by some of the tests in the suite, and not needing to know the status of the product as frequently due to low usage on weekends. Since the timezone is set to America/New_York, the schedule will automatically adjust to daylight savings time.",
